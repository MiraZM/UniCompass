# UniCompass - University Course Recommendation System

## Project Overview

UniCompass is a recommendation system project designed for university students. The primary objective is to generate a customized course schedule based on individual student preferences and requirements. The system takes into account various factors, including the student's academic goals, preferred GPA, semester difficulty, and other specifications. The end goal is to recommend the best courses, creating an optimal schedule for the chosen semester.

## Project Phases

### Data Collection

The initial step involved collecting relevant data from students to train the recommendation model. Data points included past schedules for each semester, GPA, personal information, extracurricular activities, and job specifications for those who work. This comprehensive dataset formed the basis for training the model.

### Data Cleansing

The collected data underwent thorough cleansing processes to ensure it was formatted appropriately for the model's requirements. Various techniques were applied to enhance data quality and prepare it for effective analysis and model training.

### Model Development

To determine the best algorithm for the recommendation system, the project team undertook a course on data science at DataCamp. Multiple algorithms were explored, and various solutions were tested to identify the most suitable approach for the project.

## How UniCompass Works

1. **User Input**: Students provide information such as academic goals, preferred GPA, semester difficulty, and other specifications.
2. **Data Processing**: The system processes the input data, taking into consideration the collected dataset.
3. **Algorithmic Recommendations**: Leveraging advanced algorithms, UniCompass generates personalized course recommendations and schedules.
4. **User Interface**: Students receive their recommended schedules through an intuitive user interface, allowing for feedback and adjustments.
